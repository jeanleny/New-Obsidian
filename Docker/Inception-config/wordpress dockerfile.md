php8.2-mysql      → lets PHP talk to MySQL/MariaDB databases
php8.2-curl       → WordPress uses curl to check for updates, call APIs

**The WP-CLI installation**
This stands for WordPress Command Line Interface.

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar \
    && chmod +x wp-cli.phar \
    && mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

This downloads the wp-cli.phar makes it executable and moves it where wp can reach it.

A PHAR is a packaged PHP application.

**Copy PHP-FPM config** : this replaces the default wordpress config by our own copied before from our local device.

**CMD "php-fpm8.2", "-F"** this launches the php_fpm fastcgi app. THe -F means run it in foreground so the container doesnt exits.
