	In order to use the standard in and standard out, we can use the iostream library.

here is a simple Hello world in c++
```c++
std::cout<< "Hello World" <<std::endl;
```
std stands for the [[Namespaces]] std

In this piece of code, we're using [[Insertion Operator]] to "redirect" data to a specific stream, in this case we're redirecting the content *"Hello world"* to the cout of the std [[Namespaces]].
